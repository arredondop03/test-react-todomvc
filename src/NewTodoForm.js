//anywhere where we wanted to access something from "this"
//we will do it from props. So replace whatever says this with props
//since we need functions in here that were declared in app.js we will need
//some sort of access to it so in app js we do next to the NewTodoForm tag the name of the 
//function equal to "this" over there '.' the name of the function that we need here
//its kind of taking the grabbing the 'this' over there and the actual information overe there 
//and pass it here
///////////// Done use event - use prop and bind it in App.js
